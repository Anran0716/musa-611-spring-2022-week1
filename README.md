# MUSA 611 2022,  Week 1

## Exercise

### Tools

* A GitHub account
* A git client (e.g., the [`git` CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads), or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/))
* A code editor with syntax highlighting, such as Atom, VS Code, or Sublime.

### Procedure

1.  Fork this repository to your own GitHub account, and clone it to your computer.
1.  Copy the __start.html_ file in the _introductions/_ folder to create a new called _YOURNAME.html_ (replacing "YOURNAME" with your actual name; for example, I would copy to a file named _mjumbepoe.html_).
1.  Follow the comment instructions inside of your new HTML file.
1.  Commit and push your changes back into your repository on GitHub.
1.  Submit a pull request (PR) back into this repository.

When you submit your pull request, your code will be checked automatically for a few things, including:

- Did you edit the correct file?
- Does your page contain an appropriate title?
- Did you fill out the requested sections correctly?

If all of the tests pass you will see green check marks on the pull request. If any of the tests fail, you should see red X's. You can see what tests fail by clicking on the failed tasks and reading the logs. Edit your copy of the code until all the tests show green checks (_you do not have to re-submit a new PR to get the tests to re-run; as soon as you change your code on GitHub the tests will run_).
